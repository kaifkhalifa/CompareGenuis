Product Image Instructions:

1. If you're seeing placeholder images or missing images, you can:
   - Open the create-fallback-images.html file in your browser
   - Generate custom placeholder images for each product
   - Save them with the correct filenames

2. For real product images, you can:
   - Download official product images from manufacturer websites
   - Rename them according to the naming convention:
     * Main image: product-name.jpg (e.g., samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra.jpg)
     * Additional views: product-name-1.jpg, product-name-2.jpg, etc.

3. Place all images in this directory (frontend/public/images/products/)

4. Restart your development server to see the changes
